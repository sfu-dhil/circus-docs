Searching
=========

Searching the clipping table is performed by selecting “`Search`_” at the top
right-hand side of the table. This links to a simple keyword search of the
transcriptions that is enabled for Boolean searching; entering a word into the
search box will bring up all clipping entries containing that word. Searching
for multiple words will bring up all entries containing any of the words
entered into the search box. Searching for a phrase in quotation marks will
bring up all entries that contain that exact phrase; for example, searching for
“young astley” will pull up all entries that contain those words in that order.
Searching for +astley +horseback will bring up all entries that contain both
“astley” and “horseback,” while searching for +astley -horseback will bring up
all entries that contain “astley” but not “horseback.”
