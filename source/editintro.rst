Introduction for Editors
========================

In order to edit the content of the database, editors should log in by selecting
“Login” at the top left of the navigation bar. They will be directed to a screen
that requests their email address and password, which they should enter into the
appropriate field and then select “Login.”

New editors will have to request an account be made by the DHIL (dhil@sfu.ca).
Once an account has been made, they will need to reset the password. To do so,
they should select “reset your password” from beneath the password field, at
which point they will be prompted to enter the email address used to create
their account. Once they have done so, they can select “Request” and an email
will be sent to their inbox containing a link to reset their password. Following
the link will direct them to a page that asks them to enter the new password
twice; once they have done that, they should click “Reset,” which will take them
to their profile.

Once logged in, editors will have the ability to search, browse, edit content,
and add new content. Most work will be done on clipping entries and the
announcements, but editors can also edit and add categories and sources.
