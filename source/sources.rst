Adding and Editing Sources
==========================

Editors can also add new and edit existing sources, although they should only do
so with the express permission of the principal investigator. In this database,
a “Source” refers to the original three volumes of theatre clippings compiled by
James Winston that are held by the British Library. Since all three volumes are
already included, be sure to consult with the principal investigator before
adding other sources.

To add a new source, click on “Browse” in the navigation bar and select “Source”
from the drop-down menu. Click on “New” at the top right of the page to be
directed to the form.

The “Name” field is for internal use and should consist of lowercase letters,
numbers, and hyphens only. An abbreviated version of the Source’s proper name is
generally best practice. Filling in this field is mandatory.

The “Label” field should describe the Source in a way recognizable to people
adding and editing clipping entries. Filling in this field is mandatory.

The “Description” field contains information about how to find the source, for
example the library that it is held in and its call number.
