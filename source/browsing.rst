The `home page`_ contains an image carousel. Users can navigate between the images
by selecting the arrows to the right and left of the image displayed. Below the
carousel is a brief history of Astley’s circus and its performances, including
the role it played in the history of the circus more generally.

To view images of the clippings, select “`Clippings`_” from the drop-down menu
under “Browse” on the menu bar at the top of the page. Here, you will
encounter a list of the images of the clippings organized by publication date,
with undated clippings listed first.

Thumbnail images appear on the left, with the image name above three lines of
the transcription from the image. Both the thumbnail and image name link to
that clipping’s entry. There are multiple pages of clippings; users can
navigate between pages by scrolling to the bottom of the page and selecting
“Next” or the page number they wish to look at.
