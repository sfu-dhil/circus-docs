Adding and Editing Categories
=============================

Editors have the ability to edit and add categories, although they should only
do so with the express permission of the principal investigator. In this
database, a “category” refers to the medium and/or genre of the clipping. To
add a new category, click on “Browse” in the navigation bar and select
“Categories” from the drop-down menu. Select “New” at the top right of the page
to be directed to a form.

The “Name” field is for internal use and should consist of lowercase letters,
numbers, and hyphens only. An abbreviated version of the Category’s proper name
is generally best practice. For example, “Song Lyrics” become “song-lyrics” in
this field. Filling in this field is mandatory.

The “Label” field should describe the medium and/or genre in a way recognizable
to people adding and editing clipping entries. Filling in this field is
mandatory.

The “Description” field should contain a brief one-sentence explanation of what
the category consists of.

Once you have entered all the information that you wish to enter, select
“Create” at the bottom of the page. If you change your mind and no longer wish
to add this category, select “Cancel.”

To edit an existing “Category” entry, click on “Browse” in the top left of the
navigation bar and select “Categories” from the drop-down menu. Click on the
category that you would like to edit; doing so will bring you to the entry page
for that category. Selecting “Edit” from the top right of the page will bring
you to the same form used to create new entries. Make your desired changes and
then select “Update.” Select “Cancel” to discard the changes.
